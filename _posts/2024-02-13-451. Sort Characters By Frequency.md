LeetCode Link: [451. Sort Characters By Frequency](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-characters-by-frequency/description/)  
Language: `C#`  

## Problem Statement
Given a string s, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of the characters. The frequency of a character is the number of times it appears in the string.

Return the sorted string. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

## Examples

Example 1:

Input: s = "tree"
Output: "eert"
Explanation: 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
Example 2:

Input: s = "cccaaa"
Output: "aaaccc"
Explanation: Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so both "cccaaa" and "aaaccc" are valid answers.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
Example 3:

Input: s = "Aabb"
Output: "bbAa"
Explanation: "bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.


## Constraints  

* 1 <= s.length <= 5 * 105
* s consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters and digits.

## Solution

``` csharp
public class Solution 
{
    public string FrequencySort(string s) 
    {
        var pq = new PriorityQueue<char, int>();
        var dict = new Dictionary<char, int>();

        foreach (var c in s)
        {
            if (!dict.ContainsKey(c))
            {
                dict[c] = 0;
            }
            dict[c] = dict[c] - 1;
        }

        foreach (var k in dict.Keys)
        {
            pq.Enqueue(k, dict[k]);
        }

        var sb = new StringBuilder();
        while (pq.Count > 0)
        {
            var c = pq.Dequeue();
            var k = Math.Abs(dict[c]);
            for (int i=0; i<k; i++)
            {
                sb.Append(c);
            }
        }

        return sb.ToString();
    }
}
```
