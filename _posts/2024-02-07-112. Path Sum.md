LeetCode Link: [ 112. Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum/description/)  
Language: `C#`  

## Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return true if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals targetSum.

A leaf is a node with no children.

## Examples

Example 1:

![img1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/18/pathsum1.jpg)  
Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,null,1], targetSum = 22  
Output: true  
Explanation: The root-to-leaf path with the target sum is shown.  

Example 2:

![img1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/18/pathsum2.jpg)  
Input: root = [1,2,3], targetSum = 5  
Output: false  
Explanation: There two root-to-leaf paths in the tree:  
(1 --> 2): The sum is 3.  
(1 --> 3): The sum is 4.  
There is no root-to-leaf path with sum = 5.  

Example 3:

Input: root = [], targetSum = 0  
Output: false  
Explanation: Since the tree is empty, there are no root-to-leaf paths.  


## Constraints  

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000].
* -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
* -1000 <= targetSum <= 1000


## Solution

``` csharp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     public int val;
 *     public TreeNode left;
 *     public TreeNode right;
 *     public TreeNode(int val=0, TreeNode left=null, TreeNode right=null) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
public class Solution 
{
    public bool HasPathSum(TreeNode root, int targetSum) 
    {
        return HasSum(root, targetSum, 0);
    }

    private bool HasSum(TreeNode root, int target, int sum)
    {
        if (root is null)
        {
            return false;
        }

        sum += root.val;
        if (root.left is null && root.right is null)
        {
            return sum == target;
        }

        return HasSum(root.left, target, sum) || HasSum(root.right, target, sum);
    }
}
```
